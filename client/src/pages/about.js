          Still undergoing both design and development, 'Living in a Video Game' invites users to explore the concept of navigating psychological trauma
          through the world of video gaming. While the narrative and game design is still in the works, the foundation of the software technical stack will be
          built using Gatsby and WebGL, making the future product both performant and accessible to anyone with a device that has a browser and connection
          to the web.
